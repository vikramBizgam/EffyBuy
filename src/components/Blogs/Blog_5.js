                    Traditional procurement is identified by manual events like calling the vendors and 
                    buyers, approvals, writing RFX’s, negotiations, etc. that include repetitive 
                    and small tasks. However, these processes are not very 
                    efficient or accurate and thus require many follow-ups.

                    There is risk involved in all types and varities of business world, amongst theose, some 
                    can be named as supply risks, market risks, cost, quality, frauds and others.
                    There are some newly identified risks like anti-corruption and following laws / rules. 
                    These are relevant for the entire procurement cycle, hence it has to be given due 
                    importance and not possible to be ignored.

                    Extensive secondary research, political bargaining, strong long term supplier realtionships, 
                    and better communication involved internally and externally can help reduce or mitigatge

                    Identifying supplier that can meet up with quality and timely delivery of product requirement 
                    can sort many of the hassels into the procurement cycle. Maintaining a pool few suppliers and 
                    getting quotes from them versus just one supplier can create demand versus supply deficiet at 
                    times or even some other issues might occur. 

                    <br/>
                     The best solution to this is regular evaluation and continuous monitoring. Supplier performance 
                     can be monitored by ensuring that delivery demands and standards are met. A good supplier 
                     relationship is important for the smooth functioning of the procurement process.

                    Not sharing of important information or delivery details or any other specifications can 
                    create issues in procurment cycle. Also companies tend to not involved suppliers during

                    It is essential to consider suppliers as a part of your organisation hence can give them 
                    demand related / futuristic view and also visions details. This can create a harmonious

                    Bad data can lead to wrong decisions and thereby incurring loss due to procurement 
                    activities that hamper entire business profits. Thus access to right kind of data is

                    to get into win scenario for the business.

                    The one best solution could be for good purchase is based on right / appropriate data base. 
                    Given this challenge organisation tend to incur losses operationally and financially. 
                    Procurement on a whole is strategic process and nothing that works on gut feel or instincts. 
                    Implementation of the best procurement process includes integrating different measures and 
                    high performance tasks to solve the above challenge. 

                    <br/>
                    These challenges in procurement hinder the growth of the business and create room 
                    for financial and operational losses. However, procurement should 
                    be a strategic and insightful process rather than based on instincts. 
                    <br/>
                    Procurement is the entire process of sourcing, negotiating, imperative and strategic selections, 
                    and many other steps. The implementation of the best procurement processes will 
                    help seek a comprehensive approach and integrate different measures and 
                    high-performance processes to solve these problems.
