                    You may be aware whether a wholesaler or retailer, direct sale or a large multilevel 
                    chain, the need always is to build good relationships with your suppliers. 
                    The basic process to get this done is by a procurement manager who manages 
                    it in the system so; he is able to reduce cost and get greater ROI. 
                    Your profit margin is the metric that should be 
                    always on the radar of the procurement manager.

                <div className="individual_blog_paragraph">
                    But how cool it would be if the manager’s knowledge about procurement 
                    for better profitability, is added with technology and automated auction 
                    strategies and techniques. The simplest way of doing this would be to invest 
                    in the best procurement management solution offering tool.

                    Significant challenges that typically faced by a procurement manager 
                    while taking actions are:

                            Dealing with a large network of vendors by meeting up with specific 
                            requirements can result in errors. This might have a huge impact on the 
                            profitability in the long run. Just so to avoid any mishap due to the error 
                            the manager would have to revisit the list of 
                            vendors and carry on the process one more time

                            Although the process is considered long haul, there are times when the goods 
                            are ordered in urgency to complete a particular task or meet a deadline. 
                            As a result, all the steps and rules are not followed. This might result 
                            into increase of risk and failure of the process impacting your profitability

                            Matters related to suppliers are perhaps the most significant challenge that supply

                            There are some purchases that are too small or insignificant to go through the 
                            entire lengthy sourcing process and to be added on to cataloging. Though, 
                            these purchases may seem small individually but if calculated on an annual 
                            basis may cost a huge, which were uncontrolled. These are known as 
                            ‘dark purchasing’. But if handled by an automated tool or a system even
