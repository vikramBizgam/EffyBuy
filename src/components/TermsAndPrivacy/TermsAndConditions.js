                            Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties 
                            or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or 
                            incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you.

                            These Terms shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the

                            Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be 
                            considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is 
                            held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of 
                            these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement 
                            between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior 
                            agreements we might have had between us regarding the Service.

                            notice before any new terms taking effect. 
                            What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.
